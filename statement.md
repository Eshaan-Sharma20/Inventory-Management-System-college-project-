# Inventory Management System — Project Statement

## 🔹 Problem Statement
Small shop owners usually write their stock details in notebooks, and it becomes difficult to track how many items are left, which products need restocking, and whether a sale resulted in profit or loss. Keeping everything updated manually can lead to mistakes.  
This project aims to solve that problem by creating a simple program that manages stock automatically and shows all important details whenever the shop owner needs them.

## 🔹 Scope of the Project
The system mainly focuses on basic day-to-day inventory tasks. With this project, the shop owner can:
- Add new items to the stock
- Update details of items that already exist
- Record a sale and reduce the stock automatically
- Calculate profit or loss made from each sale
- Check which items are running low in quantity
- See overall business performance

The program runs in the terminal and stores data temporarily while the application is running.
